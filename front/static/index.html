            <h3 class="instructions__subtitle">What can I use it for?</h3>
            <p class="instructions--text">
              You can use Code Paster to share code or any kind of text with
              partners, students, colleagues, etc. The trainer role (who can be
              one or more people) is allowed to write and read text. However,
              the student role is only allowed to read it. This particularity
              makes Code Paster a great and simple application to be used in any
              kind of online activity which requires text to be shared.
